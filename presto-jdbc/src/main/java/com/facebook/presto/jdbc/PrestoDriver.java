     * The relationship between the PrestoDriver, QueryExecutors, and
     * PrestoConnections is complicated:
     *
     * PrestoConnection <-many:one-> QueryExecutor <-many:one-> PrestoDriver
     *                               (HTTP client)
     *
     * - A PrestoConnection represents the outside world's view of a JDBC
     * connection to a Presto server.
     * - A PrestoConnection contains a QueryExecutor, which is responsible
     * for actually executing queries against the Presto server.
     * - QueryExecutor contains a reference to a driver-wide pool of execution
     * resources, and an HTTP client that executes requests using the resources
     * in that pool.
     *
     * An HTTP client is expensive to create and destroy, and we would like to
     * share it across as many PrestoConnections as possible. If every
     * connection could use the same HTTP client, life would be simple.
     * Unfortunately, some things that can be specified at the PrestoConnection
     * level must be configured at the HTTP client level. The obvious case of
     * this is the SSL/TLS trust store configuration: An HTTP client has to be
     * configured with the appropriate trust store to make SSL connections to a
     * Presto server.
     *
     * The PrestoDriver deals in QueryExecutors, which have a 1:1 relationship
     * with HTTP clients. In order to create many PrestoConnections with the
     * same QueryExecutor, the PrestoDriver maintains a cache of
     * QueryExecutors.
     *
     * This leaves us having to solve one of the two hard problems in computer
     * science: cache invalidation, which in this case, is closely intertwined
     * with the need to eventually close the HTTP client contained in the
     * cached QueryExecutor.
     *
     * Conceptually, the flow is simple:
     * driver.connect() returns either
     * 1) A cached QueryExecutor that has an HTTP client that satisfies the
     *    requested connection properties.
     * 2) A new QueryExecutor with a new HTTP client if no cached
     *    QueryExecutor is satisfactory.
     *
     * connection.close() calls queryExecutor.close()
     * If this is the last reference to the queryExecutor, close the HTTP
     * client and invalidate() queryExecutor from the cache.
     *
     * Now we need a reference count. And things get hairy, because the cache
     * updates and reference count manipulation need to happen atomically.
     *
     * The solution is to protect the refcounts by synchronizing on the cache
     * and incrementing and decrementing the refcount while holding the cache's
     * monitor. This probably doesn't scale to gazillions of operations per
     * second, but we're operating on the assumption that it doesn't have to.
     * Presumably anybody who wants a connection probably also wants to use it,
     * and the lifetime of a connection is dominated by the time it takes to
     * actually run queries.
     *
     * This logic is encapsulated in ReferenceCountingLoadingCache. get() and
     * close() operations call acquire() and release(), respectively.
     *
     * The last wrinkle is that we need to retain released() QueryExecutors
     * for some short time period to handle cases where somebody releases the
     * last reference to a QE, but is going to reacquire it immediately. This
     * requires scheduling cache invalidation into the future, which adds yet
     * more joy to our lives, as detailed below.
     *
     * The cleaner count handles the following situation:
     *
     * Thread T1 has a reference on V for key K.
     * T1 calls release(K1) scheduling future F1 and increments cleaner count -> 1
     * time passes.
     * A daemon thread starts executing F1, but does not acquire the lock
     * Thread T2 calls acquire() and acquires the lock.
     *   acquire() increments the refcount
     *   acquire tries, but fails to cancel F1 because F1 isn't is running
     *     but is not interruptible.
     *   acquire() releases the lock
     *
     * At this point 2 things can happen
     * 1) F1 resumes executing. At this point the refcount is sufficient to
     *    ensure correctness
     * 2) T2 calls release(K1)
     *      release() acquires the lock.
     *      release schedules a cleanup F2 and increments cleaner count -> 2
     *      release fails to cancel F1 for the same reason acquire did.
     *      release() releases the lock.
     *    F1 resumes executing and acquires the lock.
     *      releaseForCleaning() decrements cleaner count -> 1
     *      nothing further happens.
     *    more time passes.
     *    F2 executes
     *      releaseForCleaning() decrements cleaner count -> 0
     *      refcount is 0
     *      K1 is invalidated from the cache, and V1 is disposed.
     *
     * Without the cleaner count, we run the risk that some thread T3 calls
     * acquire(K1), loading V2 while more time passes. F2 is still using V1's
     * Holder, which has a refcount of zero. F1 then invalidates K1, which
     * disposes of V2 while it's still being used by T3. Havoc ensues.
     *
     * Instead of keeping a cleaner count, we could have a boolean flag in the
     * Holder that tracks whether or not the value has been invalidated. The
     * cleaner count has the advantage of ensuring the desired retention period
     * as well as guarding against the above situation, so it's all around
     * better.
     *
     * The other, other approach would be to set an 'invalidate after' time
     * in the holder. Now we have to worry about clock resolution, jitter, and
     * monotonicity. No thanks; somebody did that work for the ScheduledFuture/
     * ScheduledExecutorService, let's take advantage of that.
     *
     * The last case of interest is the process that is using PrestoDriver
     * calling prestoDriver.close(). This invalidates all of the cached
     * QueryExecutors regardless of their refcount by calling the cache's
     * close() method, and in doing so closes their HTTP clients. If anybody is
     * still trying to use a PrestoConnection created by the driver, they're
     * SOL.
